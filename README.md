# ABM Project: Household Adoption of Renewable Energies
Group 16: Costanza D'Ercole, Eleni Liarou, Sofia Tété Garcia Ramos Nunes, Zoë Azra Blei

### Overview
This project presents an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates the adoption of solar panels in a heterogeneous urban environment. The model explores how factors like income level, housing type, environmental consciousness, peer influence, and government subsidies interact to shape the dynamics of solar panel adoption in cities.

The simulation is designed to analyze how targeted subsidies can increase solar adoption, especially in low and middle-income neighborhoods, and how social influence mechanisms can lead to clustered adoption patterns.
